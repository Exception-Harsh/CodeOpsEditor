# ☁️ CodeOpsEditor
The only online web-based code editor you need for your DevOps programming languages and few other languages.

It is built for **[WeMakeDevs x Napptive Hackathon](https://napptive.com/blog/cloud-native-hackathon/)**.

## 💫 Story Behind Building CodeOpsEditor
Developers often code in **Visual Studio Code** or online code editors like **CodeSandox**, **Replit**, **Codepen**, **Programiz**, **GeeksForGeeks** and other such coding platforms. But there are no DevOps based coding platforms or coding IDE which only supports those languages and useful for DevOps engineers. 

We made it easy for people who are learning DevOps or a pro in this field of tech. They can use their favorite theme and code in our beautiful online editor just by signing up.

For programmers, we have kept some languages liek Java, Python, JavaScript, Typescript. They can use it seamlessly and increase their productivity level.
